Password Generator

This is a simple password generator program written in Python. It generates a random password of a specified length, using a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Usage

To use the password generator, simply run the password_generator.py script in a Python environment. The default length of the generated password is 12 characters, but you can adjust this by changing the length variable in the script.

#define password length

length = 12

The script will output the generated password in the terminal.

$ python password_generator.py

Output:
